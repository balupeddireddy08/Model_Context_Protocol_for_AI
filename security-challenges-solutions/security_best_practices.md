# MCP Security Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices for securing Machine Conversation Protocol (MCP) implementations.

## Authentication

- Use strong authentication mechanisms such as OAuth 2.0, JWT, or API keys
- Implement multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Store credentials securely, never in plaintext
- Use secure password hashing algorithms with appropriate salt and work factors

## Authorization

- Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Validate user permissions for every request
- Implement proper session management
- Use fine-grained permissions for different operations

## Data Protection

- Always use TLS/SSL for data in transit
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement proper data masking for logs and error messages
- Consider end-to-end encryption for highly sensitive conversations
- Have a clear data retention and deletion policy

## API Security

- Validate and sanitize all input
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Use API versioning to manage changes
- Return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Implement proper error handling without leaking sensitive information

## Monitoring and Incident Response

- Log all security-relevant events
- Implement automated monitoring and alerting
- Have an incident response plan
- Conduct regular security reviews and audits
- Stay updated on security vulnerabilities in dependencies

## Compliance Considerations

- Understand relevant regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Implement data privacy controls
- Keep detailed audit logs for compliance reporting
- Conduct regular privacy impact assessments
- Document security measures and policies
